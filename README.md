I'm a solo developer and creative technologist.
I build SaaS tools, creative experiments, and AI-powered apps — all from the intersection of code, creativity, and curiosity.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **Slightly Better, Co.** — my new venture for bootstrapped SaaS tools that aim to make life *slightly better*.

### 💡 What I Tinker With
- Dev containers, Docker, and self-hosted stacks.
- Raspberry Pi projects + creative hardware hacks.
- Experimental apps blending art, storytelling, and technology.
